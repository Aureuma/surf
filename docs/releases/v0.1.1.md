# v0.1.1 - Persistent Settings and Release Discipline

## Highlights

- Added persistent Surf settings at `~/.si/surf/settings.toml` with automatic bootstrap and new `surf config` commands (`show|get|set|path|init`).
- Improved runtime consistency by making tunnel and browser defaults settings-driven while still honoring `SURF_*` env overrides.
- Improved host runtime reliability and startup behavior.

## Added

- Added persistent Surf settings at `~/.si/surf/settings.toml` with automatic directory/file bootstrap.
- Added `surf config` subcommands: `show|get|set|path|init`.
- Added coverage for settings load/write behavior and default resolution in `cmd/surf/settings_test.go`.

## Changed

- Updated tunnel startup defaults to read from Surf settings while still honoring `SURF_*` environment overrides.
- Updated browser/runtime defaults to read from Surf settings and state directory configuration.
- Expanded release documentation by adopting SI-style runbook and release policy docs.

## Fixed

- Improved startup behavior by best-effort settings bootstrap on bare `surf` invocation.
- Improved host runtime reliability when running as root (profile and data-dir handling).
